## 👩‍🍳 Instructions

### 1. Prepare the Eggplant
1. Slice **2 medium eggplants** into **1 cm (½ inch)** thick rounds or lengthwise slices.  
2. Sprinkle both sides generously with **1 tbsp salt**, then lay on a rack or paper towel.  
3. Let sit for **20–30 minutes** to draw out moisture and bitterness.  
4. Pat the slices dry thoroughly with a clean towel.

### 2. Set Up Breading Station
1. Place **½ cup flour** in one shallow bowl.  
2. In a second bowl, whisk **3 eggs** with **2 tbsp milk**.  
3. In a third bowl, combine **3 cups crushed cornflakes**, **¼ cup Parmesan (optional)**, **1 tsp oregano**, **½ tsp smoked paprika**, **½ tsp salt**, and **a few grinds of black pepper**.  
   > Tip: crush cornflakes lightly — you want small flakes, not powder, for texture.

### 3. Coat the Eggplant
1. Dredge each slice in **flour**, shaking off excess.  
2. Dip in the **egg mixture**, letting extra drip off.  
3. Press firmly into the **cornflake mix**, coating both sides.  
4. Place coated slices on a tray.  
   > For extra crunch, rest the coated slices 5–10 minutes before frying so the coating adheres.

### 4. Fry Until Golden
1. Heat **½ cm of oil** in a large frying pan over **medium heat**.  
2. Once hot (test with a crumb — it should sizzle immediately), fry eggplant slices in batches for **2–3 minutes per side**, until deep golden brown.  
3. Transfer to a wire rack or paper towel to drain excess oil.  
4. Sprinkle with a pinch of salt while still hot.

## 🍋 Serving Ideas

## 🧊 Meal Prep Notes
- **Fridge:** Keeps 3 days. Reheat in oven or air fryer for 10 minutes at 180 °C.  
- **Freezer:** Freeze uncooked schnitzels in a single layer with parchment between slices. Cook from frozen — just add a few extra minutes.  
- **Reheat tip:** Avoid microwaving; it softens the crust.
