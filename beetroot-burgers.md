# Beetroot Burgers

## Ingredients

### Burger Mixture
- 5 cups shredded beetroot  
- 2.5 cups rolled oats  
- 1 large onion, finely chopped  
- 4 garlic cloves, finely chopped  
- 5 eggs  
- 3 tbsp olive oil  
- 250 g feta cheese, crumbled  

### For Frying
- 3 tbsp coconut oil (add in parts as needed)  

### For Serving
- Toasted buns  
- Sliced mango  
- Lettuce  
- Tomato  

### Vegan Option
- Replace eggs with chia seeds (1 egg = 1 tbsp chia seeds + 3 tbsp water, soaked until gel-like)  
- Replace feta with tofu, crumbled  

## Instructions
1. **Prepare the mixture**  
   - In a large bowl, combine beetroot, oats, onion, garlic, eggs, olive oil, and crumbled feta.  
   - Mix well and leave for 30 minutes to allow oats to soak up the liquid.  

2. **Prepare toppings**  
   - While the mixture rests, prepare the toasted buns, sliced mango, lettuce, and tomato.  

3. **Shape and cook**  
   - Shape the mixture into balls, then flatten into patties.  
   - Heat coconut oil in a skillet.  
   - Fry patties in batches, adding more coconut oil as needed (the mixture absorbs it).  
   - Cook each side until golden and cooked through.  

4. **Assemble**  
   - Place beetroot patties in buns with mango, lettuce, and tomato.  

## Serving Suggestion
Best served hot with sweet potato wedges or a fresh green salad.
