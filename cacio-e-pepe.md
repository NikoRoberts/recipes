# Cacio e Pepe

## Ingredients (2 servings)
- 200 g spaghetti (or tonnarelli)  
- 100 g Pecorino Romano cheese, finely grated  
- 2 tsp freshly cracked black pepper  
- Salt, for pasta water  

## Instructions

1. **Cook the pasta**  
   - Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  
   - Cook spaghetti until just al dente.  
   - Reserve about 1 cup of pasta cooking water, then drain.  

2. **Toast the pepper**  
   - In a large skillet, toast the black pepper over medium heat for about 1 minute until fragrant.  
   - Add a splash of reserved pasta water to create a peppery broth.  

3. **Make the cheese paste**  
   - In a bowl, combine finely grated Pecorino Romano with a ladle of hot pasta water.  
   - Stir until it forms a creamy paste (this prevents clumping).  

4. **Bring it together**  
   - Add the drained pasta to the skillet with pepper water. Toss well.  
   - Remove from heat, then stir in the cheese paste, adding splashes of pasta water as needed to create a silky sauce that coats the noodles.  

5. **Serve**  
   - Plate immediately with extra Pecorino Romano and black pepper on top.  

## Tips
- Use **very finely grated Pecorino Romano** for the smoothest sauce.  
- Work **off the heat** when adding cheese to avoid clumping.  
- The key is balancing cheese, pepper, and pasta water until glossy.
