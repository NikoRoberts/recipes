4. **Assemble the bowls**  
   - Divide the soba noodles between two bowls.  
   - Add the pickled cucumber, edamame, and salmon to each bowl.  
   - Mix the remaining 2 tbsp teriyaki marinade with the cucumber vinegar, then drizzle over the bowls.

## Quick Notes
- **Noodle swaps**: You can replace soba with rice noodles, udon, or egg noodles.  
- **Make it vegetarian**: Swap salmon for tofu or tempeh.
