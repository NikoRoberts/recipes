# Chickpea Veggie Burgers

## Servings
Yields 6–8 burgers (or more if making sliders/nuggets)

## Ingredients
- 1 × 540 g can chickpeas (about 2 cups cooked), drained, rinsed, and mashed  
- 50 g red onion (about 1/3 cup), finely diced  
- 100 g zucchini (about 1 cup lightly packed), grated  
- 15 g fresh coriander, finely chopped (about 3 tbsp)  
- 45 ml red wine vinegar (or apple cider vinegar)  
- 15 ml sriracha (or hot sauce/chili paste, to taste)  
- 30 g peanut butter (or almond butter / tahini for nut-free)  
- 1 tsp ground cumin  
- 1 tsp garlic powder  
- 2 tsp black pepper (adjust if preferred milder)  
- 1/2 tsp salt  
- 100 g quick oats  
- 30 ml extra-virgin olive oil  

## Instructions

1. **Mash the chickpeas**  
   - Place chickpeas in a bowl and mash with a fork or pulse a few times in a food processor. You want some texture, not a paste.  

2. **Mix the ingredients**  
   - Add onion, zucchini, coriander, vinegar, sriracha, peanut butter, spices, oats, and olive oil. Mix thoroughly with hands or spatula, but don’t over-mash.  

3. **Form patties**  
   - Shape the mixture into 6–8 burger patties (or more if making sliders or nuggets).  

4. **Cook the patties**  
   - **Pan-fry**: Heat a little oil in a frying pan and cook for ~5 minutes per side until browned and firm.  
   - **Oven-bake**: Preheat oven to 200 °C and bake for ~20 minutes, flipping halfway.  
   - **Grill/BBQ**: Cook for ~10–15 minutes, flipping occasionally until crisp.  

## Serving Ideas  
- Serve in buns with lettuce, tomato, onion, ketchup, or mustard.  
- Wrap in lettuce leaves for a lighter option.  
- Make smaller patties or nuggets with dipping sauces like spicy mayo or tzatziki.  

## Make-Ahead & Storage  
- **Fridge**: Store cooked patties for up to 4–5 days in an airtight container.  
- **Freezer**: Freeze cooked patties for up to 3 months. Thaw before reheating.  
- **Reheat**: Warm in a pan or oven (180 °C for 10–12 minutes). Microwave works but may soften the texture.  
- **Raw prep**: Form patties and store covered in the fridge to cook the next day.
