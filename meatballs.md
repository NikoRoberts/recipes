## Instructions

### 1. Prepare the Meatball Mixture  
1. Grate the onion over a bowl to extract both pulp and juice (you’ll get about ½ cup grated onion + its juice).  
2. Add the torn bread pieces to the grated onion and let them soak while you prep other ingredients (about 5 minutes).  
3. In the bowl, add ground beef, ground pork, egg, parsley, garlic, Parmesan, salt, and pepper.  
4. Use your hands to mix gently until just combined (avoid overworking).  
5. Shape the mixture into balls using heaped tablespoons (this recipe yields ~20 small to medium meatballs).  

### 2. Brown the Meatballs  
1. Heat **1.5 tbsp olive oil** in a large nonstick fry pan over medium-high heat.  
2. Add the meatballs and brown all sides (~3–4 minutes), but they don’t need to be fully cooked.  
3. Transfer meatballs to a plate when browned.

### 3. Make the Sauce & Finish Cooking  
1. In the same pan, add **1 tbsp olive oil**, then the chopped onion and garlic. Sauté 2–3 minutes until fragrant.  
2. Add tomato passata, water, red pepper flakes, dried herb mix, salt, and pepper. Bring to a gentle simmer.  
3. Carefully add the browned meatballs (and any juices from the plate) into the sauce.  
4. Simmer for 8–10 minutes, turning occasionally, until meatballs are cooked through and sauce has thickened.  
5. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed.

### 4. Serve  
1. Prepare pasta according to package instructions.  
2. Plate pasta, top with meatballs and generous sauce.  
3. Garnish with extra Parmesan and chopped parsley.

## Tips & Notes  
- **Bread soak trick:** Soaking bread in onion pulp (rather than milk) gives extra flavour and helps keep the meatballs soft.  
- **Alternate binders:** You can substitute bread with panko breadcrumbs, but texture may differ.  
- **Baking option:** Place meatballs on a rack over a tray, spray with oil, bake at 200 °C for 20 minutes, then simmer in sauce.  
- **Adjustments:** Use just beef if you don’t like pork. Use fresh herb mixes if you don’t have the dried Italian blend.

## Meal Prep Notes  
- Brown the meatballs ahead and store in sauce; reheat gently.  
- Freeze cooked meatballs in sauce for up to 2 months.  
- Reheat on low, adding a splash of water if sauce thickens too much.

## Serving Suggestions  
- Serve over spaghetti or rigatoni.  
- Offer with crusty bread or garlic toast to mop up sauce.  
- Add a side salad or steamed greens to lighten the meal.
