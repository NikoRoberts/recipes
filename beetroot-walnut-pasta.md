## 👩‍🍳 Instructions

### 1. Roast the beet mixture  
1. Preheat oven to **200°C**.  
2. Place **500 g beet wedges**, **4 unpeeled garlic cloves**, **3–4 rosemary sprigs**, and **70 g walnuts** onto a sheet of baking paper or parchment.  
3. Drizzle with **30 ml olive oil** and **30 ml balsamic vinegar**, and season with **salt & pepper**.  
4. Fold into a sealed parcel (en papillote).  
5. Roast for **40–50 minutes**, until the beets are completely tender.  
   - *Tip:* If walnuts brown too fast, remove them at the 20-minute mark.

### 2. Cook the pasta  
1. Boil **350 g pasta** in salted water until al dente.  
2. Reserve **500 ml pasta water** and drain.

### 3. Blend the sauce  
1. Squeeze the roasted garlic from their skins into a blender.  
2. Add the rest of the roasted contents: **beets**, **walnuts**, and **a few rosemary leaves** (discard tough stems).  
3. Add **15 g honey** (optional).  
4. Start blending with **100 ml** of the reserved pasta water.  
5. Add more pasta water gradually (up to **250 ml total**) until the sauce becomes smooth, pourable, and creamy.  
6. Taste and adjust:  
   - more balsamic for tang  
   - more salt/pepper  
   - optional **50 ml cream** or **2 tbsp yogurt** for silkiness

### 4. Combine  
1. Return pasta to a warm pot.  
2. Pour in the beet sauce and heat gently for **1–2 minutes** so it emulsifies and coats the pasta.

### 5. Serve  
Top with:  
- shaved Parmesan  
- lemon zest  
- extra toasted walnuts  
- cracked black pepper
