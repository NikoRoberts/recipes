## ✨ Variations & Notes
- Swap **mandarins** for roasted pumpkin or pear slices for a more autumnal version.  
- Use **toasted walnuts or almonds** instead of candied pecans for less sweetness.  
- Goat cheese or blue cheese works beautifully in place of feta.  
- For make-ahead: keep dressing separate and toss at the last moment.
