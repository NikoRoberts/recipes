## 👩‍🍳 Instructions

### 1. Prepare the Greens  
1. If using fresh spinach: wash thoroughly and remove tough stems.  
2. Heat **4 tbsp olive oil** in a large pan over medium heat.  
3. Add **1 chopped onion** and sauté **5–6 minutes** until soft.  
4. Add **2 minced garlic cloves** (and spring onions if using) and cook 1 minute.  
5. Add spinach in batches, cooking down until wilted *(≈ 3–4 minutes if fresh; warmed through if frozen)*.  
6. Transfer to a colander, cool slightly, then squeeze out excess liquid.  

### 2. Mix the Filling  
1. In a large bowl, combine the cooked spinach mixture with **feta**, **dill**, **parsley**, and **2 beaten eggs**.  
2. Season with **salt and black pepper** *(remember feta is salty—taste first)*.  
3. Stir well until evenly mixed.

### 3. Layer the Phyllo  
1. Preheat oven to **200°C / 400°F**.  
2. Grease a baking dish (≈ 33 x 23 cm / 13 x 9 in).  
3. Unroll the phyllo sheets and cover with a slightly damp towel to prevent drying.  
4. Place **1 sheet of phyllo** in the dish, brush lightly with olive oil.  
5. Repeat layering **6–8 sheets**, brushing each with oil.

### 4. Add Filling & Finish Layers  
1. Spread the spinach–feta filling evenly over the phyllo base.  
2. Fold edges of phyllo over the filling if needed.  
3. Continue layering remaining phyllo sheets on top, brushing each with oil.  
4. Tuck overhangs in and make the top surface smooth.  
5. Brush the top layer generously with oil.

### 5. Bake  
1. Using a sharp knife, score a diamond or square pattern through the top layers *(helps steam escape and makes serving easy)*.  
2. Bake for **30–40 minutes**, until golden and crisp on top.

### 6. Serve  
Let rest **10 minutes**, then cut along scored lines and serve warm or at room temperature.

## 💡 Tips
- If using **frozen spinach**, make sure it’s very well drained — too much water will make the filling soggy.  
- You can substitute some parsley with **mint** or **oregano** for variation.  
- Brush phyllo with **olive oil** for a lighter texture or **melted butter** for richer flavour.
