# 10-Ingredient Vegan Red Lentil Bolognese

## Ingredients
- 1½ tbsp olive oil  
- 1 large onion, diced  
- 4 garlic cloves, minced  
- 1 tsp dried oregano  
- 1 tsp dried thyme (or more oregano)  
- 1½ tsp kosher salt, plus extra to taste  
- Freshly ground black pepper, to taste  
- 1 (150 g) tube of tomato paste  
- ½ cup dry red wine (optional)  
- 3 cups vegetable broth  
- 1 cup red lentils, soaked 30–60 minutes  
- ¼ cup walnuts (or pecans), finely crushed  
- 1 (410 g) can crushed tomatoes (or whole peeled tomatoes, crushed by hand)  
- 12–16 oz (340–454 g) wide pasta (tagliatelle, pappardelle, rigatoni, penne rigate, or gnocchi)  
- 1 tbsp high-quality balsamic vinegar (or substitute with 1–2 tsp sugar)  
- Fresh parsley or basil, chopped (optional garnish)

## Instructions

1. **Soak the lentils.**  
   - Cover red lentils in water for 30–60 minutes.

2. **Sauté the aromatics.**  
   - Heat olive oil in a large deep pan or Dutch oven over medium-high heat.  
   - Add diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook until golden brown, about 9–10 minutes, adding splashes of water as needed to prevent sticking.  
   - Stir in garlic, oregano, thyme, salt, and pepper; cook for 60–90 seconds.

3. **Add tomato paste.**  
   - Stir in tomato paste and cook for 2–3 minutes until it darkens and caramelizes.

4. **Deglaze (optional).**  
   - Pour in the red wine, scrape up browned bits, and cook until alcohol aroma fades, 1–2 minutes.

5. **Build the sauce.**  
   - Add vegetable broth, soaked lentils, and crushed walnuts. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a rapid simmer for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.

6. **Add tomatoes.**  
   - Stir in crushed tomatoes. Simmer another 15–20 minutes until the lentils are tender yet still hold their shape. Add a splash of water if the sauce gets too thick.

7. **Cook the pasta.**  
   - Meanwhile, boil the pasta in salted water according to package instructions until just al dente. Reserve some pasta water before draining.

8. **Finish the sauce.**  
   - Season to taste with salt and pepper. Stir in balsamic vinegar (or sugar, if needed).

9. **Combine & serve.**  
   - Toss the cooked pasta with the sauce, using reserved pasta water if needed to coat.  
   - Garnish with parsley or basil, if desired, and serve hot.
